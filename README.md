# Atliq Hardwares - SQL + Power BI Challenge Project

**Domain:** Consumer Goods  
**Function:** Executive Management  
**Tools Used:** SQL, Power BI, PowerPoint, [Optional: Video Editing Tool]

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Atliq Hardwares (an imaginary company) is a leading computer hardware producer in India, with operations in multiple countries. Despite the companyâ€™s success, top management struggles with limited data insights, which impacts their decision-making.

To address this, Tony Sharma (Director of Data Analytics) decided to expand the analytics team and created a **challenge** to assess the technical and communication skills of potential junior data analysts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

As a candidate, my task was to:
1. Analyze 10 **ad-hoc business questions** provided in a PDF format.
2. Write **SQL queries** to answer those questions using the given database.
3. Use **Power BI** to visualize the insights in a dashboard suitable for executive-level decision-making.
4. Create a **presentation** (with optional audio/video) to communicate the findings effectively.

## ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard

- Developed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** tailored for executive management.
- Visuals include KPIs, trend analysis, and breakdowns based on the business questions.
- Designed with simplicity, clarity, and storytelling in mind.

> ðŸ“Œ Note: [Add a screenshot or GIF preview of your dashboard here â€“ optional but impactful!]
